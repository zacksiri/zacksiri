# Product Engineer 

### Hi there 👋

I build products using software as my creative tool. I've built many kinds of products.

+ 🏨 Hotel Booking
+ 🧾 Invoicing CRM
+ 🚗 Car Booking
+ 🛒 E-Commerce
+ 🌏 Location Based Directory
+ 🦹‍♂️ Customer KYC Engine
+ 💰 FinTech / Banking Engine
+ 📦 Continuous Delivery Platform

I've solved many kind of problems. I'm usually a part of the beginning of a company as a result I usually get hired as a CTO but I'm also happy just being a developer working on exciting products as a contributor. I'm used to getting my hands dirty building products and leading teams with very minimal resources. I'm great at taking things all the way from MVP to scaling to hundreds of thousands of users.

I've built APIs, front-ends, back-ends, platforms, infrastructures, worked a lot with databases writing complex queries, application performance tuning, all in the spirit of improving the lives of people that use my products.
