### Hi there 👋

## Product Engineer 

I build products using software as my creative tool. I've built many kinds of products.

- 🏨 Hotel Booking 
- 🧾 Invoicing CRM
- 🚗 Car Booking
- 🛒 E-Commerce
- 💰 FinTech

I've had to solve all kinds of problems. I'm usually a part of the beginning of a company. I'm used to building things with very minimal resources all the way from MVP to making things scale.
