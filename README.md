# Hi there 👋

## Product Engineer 

I build products using software as my creative tool. I've built many kinds of products.

🏨 Hotel Booking
🧾 Invoicing CRM
🚗 Car Booking
🛒 E-Commerce
🔍 Business Directory
💰 FinTech / Banking Engine

I've solved many kind of problems. I'm usually a part of the beginning of a company. I'm used to building things with very minimal resources all the way from MVP to making things scale to hundreds of thousands of users.

I've built APIs, front-ends, back-ends, platforms, infrastructures, worked a lot with databases writing complex queries that improve the lives of people that use my products.
