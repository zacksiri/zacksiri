# Hi there 👋

## Product Engineer 

I build products using software as my creative tool. I've built many kinds of products.

+ 🏨 Hotel Booking
+ 🧾 Invoicing CRM
+ 🚗 Car Booking
+ 🛒 E-Commerce
+ 🌏 Location Based Directory
+ 💰 FinTech / Banking Engine

I've solved many kind of problems. I'm usually a part of the beginning of a company. I'm used to building products and leading teams with very minimal resources. I'm great at taking things from MVP to scaling to hundreds of thousands of users.

I've built APIs, front-ends, back-ends, platforms, infrastructures, worked a lot with databases writing complex queries that improve the lives of people that use my products.
