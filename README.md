### Hi there 👋

I build products using software as my creative tool. I've built many kinds of products.

+ 🏨 Hotel Booking
+ 🧾 Invoicing CRM
+ 🚗 Car Booking
+ 🛒 E-Commerce
+ 🌏 Location Based Directory
+ 🦹‍♂️ Customer KYC Engine
+ 💰 FinTech / Banking Engine
+ 📦 Continuous Delivery Platform

I've solved many kind of problems. I'm usually a part of the beginning of a company as a result I usually get hired as a CTO but I'm also happy just being a developer working on exciting products as a contributor. I'm used to getting my hands dirty building products and leading teams with very minimal resources. I'm great at taking things all the way from MVP to scaling to hundreds of thousands of users.

I've built APIs, front-ends, back-ends, platforms, infrastructures, worked a lot with databases writing complex queries, application performance tuning, all in the spirit of improving the lives of people that use my products.

I strive to keep things simple, and ship things in small increments. I believe it's important to get things in front of real users as fast as possible and iterate based on real feedback. Conversations I like having about products:

+ To solve problem X for the `user` what schemas do we need in the database?
+ To achieve Y `user` experience, what elements / components do we need to build?
+ Before we build feature Z have we collected feedback from the `users`? 
+ Can we get the `users` involved in the process?
+ What can we remove to make things easier for the `user`?
+ Are we designing for the exception or designing for the majority of `users`?
+ Endpoint X is slow, `users` are complaining. How can we improve it's performance?

To enable development to focus on solving for users I employ the following:

+ Convention over Configuration
+ Great Defaults
+ Test Coverage
+ Refactoring without fear
+ Single Responsibility Principles
+ Occam's Razor mindset for Solution Design
+ Keeping it Simple
+ Continuous Integration / Deployment
